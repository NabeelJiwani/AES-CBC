# AES-256 CBC With PBKDF2 in Python

These is a Simple Sample Program to Implement AES-256 CBC Mode in Python 
 with Password Based key Derivation 2.
 
 It Stores SHA-256 hash sum of Originally Provided file to verify that after Decryption of file and Compares Hashes to verify, that Decryption was Succesfull or Not, whether Encrypted file was tampered or not.
 
 It has a bit of GUI interface. 
 

#Usage:
```
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/NabeelJiwani/AES-CBC.git
cd AES-CBC/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 encryption.py
```
